# Kanban-Method
A program to manage tasks using the method Kanban 

Welcome!

I made this project for a class called Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures using C language, during the first year of my Computer Science and Engineering degree.

The interaction with the program is made through input lines that contain a certain command as the first character and the rest follows some rules, regarding the input (everything is explained in the kanban.pdf file).

The commands are:
'q': terminates the program
't': adds a new task to the system
'l': lists all the tasks
'n': advances global time
'u': adds a new user or lists all users
'm': moves a task from an activity to another
'd': lists all tasks in a certain activity
'a': adds an activity or lists all activities

The code is mainly written in Portuguese but all the comments inside the project are all in English.

Hope you enjoy it!

Best wishes, Nuno Martins
